The output of emit (the 2nd param) and reduce should be the same format to make iterative reduce possible.

type FinalizeFun = Javascript
-- ^ @(key, value) -> final_value@. A finalize function may be run after reduction.  Such a function is optional and is not necessary for many map/reduce cases.  The finalize function takes a key and a value, and returns a finalized value.

-- ^ Translate MapReduce data into expected document form

	"limit" =: (fromIntegral rLimit :: Int),
	"keeptemp" =: rKeepTemp,
	"scope" =: rScope,
	"verbose" =: rVerbose ]

mapReduce :: Collection -> MapFun -> ReduceFun -> MapReduce
-- ^ MapReduce on collection with given map and reduce functions. Remaining attributes are set to their defaults, which are stated in their comments.
mapReduce col map' red = MapReduce col map' red [] [] 0 Nothing False Nothing [] False

runMR :: (DbAccess m) => MapReduce -> m Cursor
-- ^ Run MapReduce and return cursor of results. Error if map/reduce fails (because of bad Javascript)
-- TODO: Delete temp result collection when cursor closes. Until then, it will be deleted by the server when pipe closes.
runMR mr = find . query [] =<< (at "result" <$> runMR' mr)

runMR' :: (DbAccess m) => MapReduce -> m Document
-- ^ Run MapReduce and return a result document containing a "result" field holding the output Collection and additional statistic fields. Error if the map/reduce failed (because of bad Javascript).
runMR' mr = do
	doc <- runCommand (mrDocument mr)
	return $ if true1 "ok" doc then doc else error $ "mapReduce error:\n" ++ show doc ++ "\nin:\n" ++ show mr

-- * Command

type Command = Document
-- ^ A command is a special query or action against the database. See <http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Commands> for details.

runCommand' :: (DbAccess m) => [Notice] -> Command -> m Document
-- ^ Send notices then run command and return its result
runCommand' ns c = maybe err id <$> findOne' ns (query c "$cmd") where
	err = error $ "Nothing returned for command: " ++ show c

runCommand :: (DbAccess m) => Command -> m Document
-- ^ Run command against the database and return its result
runCommand = runCommand' []

runCommand1 :: (DbAccess m) => UString -> m Document
-- ^ @runCommand1 foo = runCommand [foo =: 1]@
runCommand1 c = runCommand [c =: (1 :: Int)]

eval :: (DbAccess m) => Javascript -> m Document
-- ^ Run code on server
eval code = at "retval" <$> runCommand ["$eval" =: code]

-- * Primitives

send :: (Context Pipe m, Throw Failure m, MonadIO m) => [Notice] -> m ()
-- ^ Send notices as a contiguous batch to server with no reply. Throw 'ConnectionFailure' if pipe fails.
send ns = do
	pipe <- context
	mapErrorIO ConnectionFailure (P.send pipe ns)

call :: (Context Pipe m, Throw Failure m, MonadIO m, Throw Failure n, MonadIO n) =>
	[Notice] -> Request -> m (n Reply)
-- ^ Send notices and request as a contiguous batch to server and return reply promise, which will block when invoked until reply arrives. This call will throw 'ConnectionFailure' if pipe fails on send, and promise will throw 'ConnectionFailure' if pipe fails on receive.
call ns r = do
	pipe <- context
	promise <- mapErrorIO ConnectionFailure (P.call pipe ns r)
